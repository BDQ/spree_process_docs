## Filing an issue

When filing an issue on the Spree project, please provide these details:

* A comprehensive list of steps to reproduce the issue.
* What you're *expecting* to happen compared with what's *actually* happening.
* Your application's complete `Gemfile.lock`, and `Gemfile.lock` as text in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) (*not as an image*)
* Any relevant stack traces ("Full trace" preferred)

In 99% of cases, this information is enough to determine the cause and solution
to the problem that is being described.

Please remember to format code using triple backticks (\```) so that it is neatly
formatted when the issue is posted.

Any issue that is open for 14 days without actionable information or activity
will be marked as "stalled" and then closed. Stalled issues can be re-opened if
the information requested is provided.
